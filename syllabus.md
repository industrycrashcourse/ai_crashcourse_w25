## Course Description
This intensive 3-week project-based course prepares seniors for the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted software development. Students will develop practical skills with AI coding assistants on short timelines, emphasizing both the capabilities and limitations of AI collaboration. Special focus is placed on setting up robust dev environments, exploring LLM fundamentals, architecting complex systems, and evaluating AI-based workflows.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Set up and use AI-centric development environments (Cursor, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, OpenAI o1)
2. Understand core LLM fundamentals and how AI agents extend them with tools, vector indexes, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
3. Architect and navigate complex software systems and large codebases
4. Validate and evaluate AI-generated code via testing strategies, TDD, and performance checks
5. Manage error handling, security, and technical debt when AI is in the loop
6. Recognize ethical, professional, and career impacts of AI-driven development
